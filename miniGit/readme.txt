MINIGIT 

VERSION CONTROL SYSTEM

MINITGIT WORKS AS A LOCAL VERSION CONTROL SYSTEM SIMILAR TO GIT TO SAVE OLD VERSIONS
OF A FILE LOCALLY TO BE RECALLED LATER INTO SYSTEM MEMORY.

ONCE THE PROGRAM IS LAUNCHED, THE USER WILL BE GREETED WITH A PROPMT TO CREATE A 
REPOSITORY FOR THE MINIGIT STORAGE. SINCE THIS PROGRAM IS NOT STATE-FUL, THE USER 
MUST CREATE A REPOSITORY OR THE PROGRAM WILL CLOSE.

THE USER WILL THEN FIND A MENU WITH ALL THE POSSIBLE ACTIONS INCLUDING ADD, REMOVE, 
COMMIT, CHECKOUT, STATUS, DIFF, AND QUIT.

ADD: THE USER WILL BE PROMPTED TO ENTER THE NAME OF A FILE IN THE DIRECTORY 
THAT THEY WISH TO ADD TO THE LIST OF FILES THAT WILL BE COMMITED. THE USER WILL 
THEN GET A MESSAGE IF THE FILE COULD NOT BE ADDED DUE TO THE FILE NOT BEING 
IN THE DIRECTORY OR ALREADY ADDED. THE USER WILL GET MESSAGE CONFIRMING THE 
FILE BEING ADDED IF IT WAS SUCCESSFUL. THE USER WILL BE UNABLE TO ADD FILES 
WHILE A NON-CURRENT VERSION OF A FILE IS CHECKED OUT.

REMOVE: THE USER WILL BE PROMPTED TO ENTER THE NAME OF THE FILE THEY WOULD 
LIKE TO REMOVE FROM THE COMMIT LIST. THE USER WILL EITHER RECIEVE A MESSGAE 
SAYING THE FILE WAS REMOVED OR NOT REMOVED DUE TO THE FILE NOT BEING ADDED. 
THE USER WILL NOT BE ABLE TO REMOVE A FILE WHILE A NON-CURRENT VERSION OF THE 
FILE IS CHECKED OUT.

COMMIT: THE USER WILL GET A MESSAGE CONFIRMING THAT THE FILES IN THE COMMIT 
LIST WERE EITHER SUCCESSFULLY COMMITED OR THE WORKING VERSION IN THE DIRECTORY 
IS THE SAME AS THE PREVIOUS COMMIT VERSION OF THE FILE. THE USER WILL NOT BE ABLE 
TO COMMIT WHILE A NON-CURRENT VERSION OF THE FILES ARE CHECKED OUT.

CHECKOUT: THE USER WILL BE PROMPTED TO ENTER A COMMIT VERSION TO CHECKOUT OLDER 
VERSIONS OF THE COMMITED FILES. THE PROGRAM WILL ASK THE USER IF THEY WOULD LIKE 
TO CONTINUE IF THE WORKING FILES ARE DIFFERENT THAN THE CURRENT COMMITED VERSIONS. 
THE COMMITED VERSIONS OF THE FILES WILL THEN BE COPIED TO THE WORKING VERSIONS 
IF THE USER CHOOSES TO CONTINUE. THE USE OF ADD, REMOVE, AND COMMIT WILL BE DISABLED 
WHILE A PREVIOUS VERSION OF THE FILES ARE CHECKED OUT.

STATUS: A LIST OF FILES THAT HAVE BEEN EDITED SINCE THE CURRENT COMMIT WILL BE 
PRINTED OUT.

DIFF: THE USER WILL BE PROMPTED TO ENTER A NAME OF THE FILE AND THE FIST LINE 
WITH A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE MOST RECENT COMMIT VERSION AND THE WORKING VERSION 
WILL BE PRINTED.

QUIT: REMOVES THE USER FROM THE PROGRAM, DELETES THE .MINIGIT REPOSITORY, AND 
CLOSES THE PROGRAM.

THE MAIN MENU WILL CONTINUE ASKING FOR ANOTHER INPUT IF NON-VALID OPTIONS ARE INPUT.
