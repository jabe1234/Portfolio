CSCI 4229 - Fall 2021

Project- Exploring different techniques in openGL

Camp Ground Island

Fog is implemented for atmospheric effect - TURNED OFF USING 'f'

USE F4-F8 TO SEE VIEWS OF EACH SCENE

F4 - Shows a view of the pond with fish swimming around in the water
   - Uses tranlucent textures to show the fishing swimming around under the water
   - Uses animation for fish to swim around along their path
   - I am very proud of this pond with the translucent textures and fishing swimming around

F5 - Shows a view of Log Cabin, a ghost hovering over the pond and a wind turbine
   - Uses animation to show smoke coming out of chimnney and the wind turbine turning in the wind
   - Ghost uses translucent textures to show other objects past the ghost through those texture

F6 - Shows a view of the forest that can be randomized by pressing 'r' or 'R'
   - Uses scaling matrices and random values to ramdomize forest to give it a more real look

F7 - Shows a view of powerline that has been broken
   - Uses a timer to create sparks from the broken wire

F8 - Shows a view of a sandbox in the camping ground
   - Shows different ways of modeling a cactus, a coconut, and a sand pyramid

I focused mainly on trying now techniques which took a lot of my time that I would have spent making more objects. 
I am very proud of the pond which incorperated two of my major goals which was using translucent textures and animation of my textures.
I also struggled with getting fog to work correctly but I also got that to function correctly in my scene.
I also am proud with how my randomized forest generates as it looks pretty realistic with tree placements and heights.
I am happy with how my sky box turned out and how it helped the appearance of the scene.
I have taken all I learned from the lectures and homework and culminated it all into this scene.

I feel that I would have been able to make much for intricate objects if I had taken algorithms or other such classes. I struggled with creating programs to create more intricate objects so I focused on other aspects of computer graphics like the effects of translucent textures and animations to enhance my scene.

Code segments taken class example 6, 8, 9, 10, 13, 14, 18, and 24

Using the CSCIx229 library made for this class

All additonal code outside of code from class examples is my own code
